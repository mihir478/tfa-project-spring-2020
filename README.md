# Squirrel Tracker Project 
## Description
### 1.Introduction
We built an application to track all the known squirrels at Central Park. Users can view the map, update the sightings, create new sightings, and see some general statistics on the web.  
[Try it!](link our website here)  

### 2. Import and export squirrels data.
Users can import and export data via command line.The file path should be specified at the command line after the name of the management command.  
Note: we already prepared squirrel dataset in home directory for users to import. The name of the dataset is 2018_Central_Park_Squirrel_Census_-_Squirrel_Data.csv  

    #import data  
    $ python manage.py import_squirrel_data /path/to/file.csv  
    #export data  
    $ python manage.py export_squirrel_data /path/to/file.csv
